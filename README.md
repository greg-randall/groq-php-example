Super basic example of an API call to Groq in PHP. 

Setup: Duplicate the file 'blank_keys.php', name it 'keys.php', and add your Groq API key in.


funcations.php has the functions:
  groq_call($prompt, $model, $temperature, $groq_key)
  groq_cost($response)

Example of how to use both functions is in index.php.
